            <h1>NO ROOM FOR SURI</h1>
            <p>No Room for Suri is a situational comedy centered around the life of Suri, an easygoing guy who often finds himself in the most unfortunate of situations. Tired of his roommate Samz, he goes around asking who he thinks are his “best friends” to be his roommates next semester, and these conversations hardly go well for him. In the end, he is stuck between a rock and a hard place to determine his next roommate.</p>
